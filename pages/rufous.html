            <p class="description">
                The rufous treepie is a treepie, native to the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining parts of Southeast
                Asia. It is a member of the crow family, Corvidae. It is long tailed and has loud musical calls making
                it very conspicuous. It is found commonly in open scrub, agricultural areas, forests as well as urban
                gardens.<br><br>

                The rufous treepie (Dendrocitta vagabunda) is a type of bird species belonging to the Corvidae family,
                genus Dendrocitta. This beautiful orange-brown bird can look quite striking but is known for its rather
                harsh, exuberant behavior which causes other wild birds to give them the cold shoulder. It is usually
                found in Southeast Asia, in warm countries such as India, Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and
                more. It is an arboreal bird, conducting all its feeding and breeding activities in trees, and is rarely
                seen on the ground. Owing to their lifestyle among the trees and on the ground, they have adapted to
                become quite agile climbers, hopping up and down the branches with great speed and precision. They are
                very opportunistic birds and have been known to disrupt picnics and outdoor gatherings in search of
                food.

                <p class="description">

                    The rufous treepie can be found in various types of deciduous forests, plantations, woodlands, and
                    dry forests. It is usually found in low-lying areas, and can also be commonly spotted in parks and
                    gardens.

                    <p class="description">
                        The breeding period of this bird species extends from March to July. The breeding period varies
                        slightly from region to region, depending on the rainy season. Birds pair up and build their
                        nest on the top of trees or in bushes, made out of twigs and well concealed by the natural
                        foliage. After mating, the female lays around three to five light brown eggs which are guarded
                        and incubated by both parents until they hatch. After the young hatch, the parents take turns
                        bringing them food until they are ready to leave the nest.
