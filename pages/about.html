                    When we think pollinators, bees and butterflies flutter to mind - but bird pollinators such as
                    hummingbirds and honey eaters also make a big contribution, espeacially in high altitude or hot
                    climates. Their roles as pollinators benifits us directly - arond 5% of the plants humaneuse for
                    food or medicine are pollinated by birds.

                    (typically within an hour of death), and their thoroughness which makes them so valuable. It could
                    be days before other less efficient scavengers, such as feral dogs or rats, arrive to pick at the
                    remains, allowing deadly diseases such as rabies and tuberculosis to develop and spread. Over its
                    lifetime, a single vulture provides waste disposal services worth around US$11,600.

                <p class="evenpara">When birds travel, they take the seeds they have eaten with them and disperse them
                    through their
                    droppings. They bring plants back to ecosystems that have been destroyed, and even carry plants
                    across the sea to new land masses. Birds have helped to shape the plant life we see around us – and
                    around the world. In New Zealand’s forests, 70% of the plants have seeds dispersed by birds

                    even those
                    living hundreds of miles away – they store carbon, keep the climate stable, oxygenate the air and
                    transform pollutants into nutrients. But without birds, many of these ecosystems may not exist.
                    Birds maintain the delicate balance between plant and herbivore, predator and prey. A perfect
                    example is the salt marshes of south-eastern USA, where cordgrass thrives, filtering local water and
                    protecting the coast from sea erosion
