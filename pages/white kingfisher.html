            <p class="description">
                The Common kingfisher is amongst the most colorful birds and has beautiful brilliant plumage, though,
                despite its extraordinary colors, sometimes it is difficult to see when it is in dappled shade, and its
                colors are also not very obvious in flight. Furthermore, its shy nature means that it is not often seen.
                Its upper parts are bright blue and its underparts a rich chestnut-red. The Male and the female are
                generally similar but the females have a bill with a red base, whereas the male has one that is
                completely black. Juveniles are similar in appearance but have duller greener plumage.

            <p class="description">
                The Common kingfisher occurs throughout Europe and in Asia as far to the east as Japan, and south of the
                Sahara in Africa. Common kingfishers live year-round in the south, while northern populations fly south
                in winter away from the freezing water. In temperate regions, these birds inhabit clear, slow-flowing
                streams and rivers, and lakes with well-vegetated banks. They frequent scrubs and bushes with
                overhanging branches close to shallow open water in which they hunt. In winter Common kingfishers are
                more coastal, often feeding in estuaries or harbors and along rocky seashores. Tropical populations are
                found near slow-flowing rivers, in mangrove creeks, and swamp
            </p>

                <p class="description">

                    As with all kingfishers, the Common kingfisher is very territorial, mainly because each day it has
                    to eat about 60% of its body weight. They even defend their territory against their mates and
                    offspring. Individuals are solitary for most of the year, roosting in heavy cover beside their
                    favorite hunting spot. When another kingfisher comes into its territory, the birds will both sit on
                    a perch at some distance from one another and perform territorial displays, usually the display of
                    beaks and plumage. Fights occasionally occur, one bird grabbing the other one’s beak and trying to
                    hold their opponent under the water. Their flight is very fast, causing their wings to seem like a
                    blue haze. These birds communicate vocally and are well known for a long, trilling call like a
                    repetition of the sound “chee”. During mating, the male whistles loudly to a female and will chase
                    her through and above the trees. When diving for prey, their eyes are covered by a membrane and they
                    rely on touch alone to know when they should snap their jaws shut.

                        Common kingfishers are serially monogamous and seek a new mate every year. They nest on their
                        own. The female is given food by the male before copulation, usually a fish. 2-3 clutches of
                        eggs are laid yearly, in April, and another by July, with sometimes, a third in early October.
                        Nests are on sandy banks along streams. Sometimes they use a hole in a wall or a rotten tree
                        stump, or a termite mound, where they dig a tunnel and at the end create a nest chamber. Both
                        male and female work to excavate a 50 to 90 cm long burrow, taking turns. 6 to 7 white eggs are
                        laid and incubation lasts around 19 to 21 days, done by both parents. Usually, the female does
                        the brooding at night and both male and female do it during the day. Young are given food by
                        both their parents and they fledge at about 23-24 days, sometimes more. Four days later they
                        make their first dive. Very soon they become independent and leave the territory where they were
                        born.<br><br>
