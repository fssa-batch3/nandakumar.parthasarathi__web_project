            <p class="description">

                The yellow-billed babbler is a member of the family Leiothrichidae endemic to southern India and Sri
                Lanka. The yellow-billed babbler is a common resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its
                habitat is scrub, cultivation and garden land. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and
                has short rounded wings and a weak flight and is usually seen calling and foraging in groups. It is
                often mistaken for the jungle babbler, whose range overlaps in parts of southern India, although it has
                a distinctive call and tends to be found in more vegetated habitats. Its name is also confused with
                Turdoides leucocephala, which is also known as white-headed babbler.

                These birds have grey brown upperparts, a grey throat and breast with some mottling, and a pale buff
                belly. The head and nape are grey, and the eyes are bluish white. The nominate race, found in southern
                India, has a whitish crown and nape, with a darker mantle.
