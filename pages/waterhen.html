            <p class="description">
                The white-breasted waterhen are small birds measuring 25 to 35 cm. The male birds are larger and weigh
                between 200 to 330 grams whereas the females weigh between 160 to 230 grams. They have dark grey upper
                parts and flanks with a clean whitish face, breast and belly. Immature birds have only traces of
                whiteness on the front. Young chicks are black. The lower belly and undertail is cinnamon colored. Their
                flattened body facilitates their movement through reeds. The waterhen call is a repetitive croaking
                sound.

                    <p class="description">
                        The white-breasted waterhen breeding season is usually between June and October, but varies
                        locally. The nest is built on dry ground in marshes. The males are monogamous. The clutch
                        consists of 6-8 eggs. Both the parents take part in incubation and raising of chicks.

                        The white-breasted waterhen are resident birds in most of their ranges. They may make local
                        movements for breeding and feeding. Some northern waterhen populations may move southwards for
                        wintering.
