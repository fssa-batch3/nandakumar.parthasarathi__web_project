            <p class="description">
                Woodpeckers scientific name is Picinea which is a part of the family Picidae. The subfamily Picinea has
                a
                variety of 180 birds including Woodpeckers. As the name suggests, it is famous for pecking into the
                woods.
                Most of the time they are found on the trunk of a tree, striking into the woods to find insects. They
                also
                peck dead woods to make nest holes where they can live.
                Woodpeckers are commonly found worldwide except in a few places. These excluded areas are New Zealand,
                New
                Guinea, Australia, and polar regions. These stunning birds are amply found in Southeast Asian and South
                American countries. They mostly like to live in forests and woodland areas where they can get enough
                trees.
                However, only some species like the Gila Woodpecker survive in rocky or desert areas.
                Some Woodpeckers don't peck wood at all. They survive in the ground by making holes through the grounds
                to
                form their nests. Also, they pick up insects from the ground for a living. These Woodpeckers are found
                in
                rocky and grassy mountains located in South Africa.

            <h3 class="topic">General Characteristics</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Woodpecker information may vary as there are multiple types. The size of Woodpeckers starts from 7cm in
                length. Also, some Woodpeckers are 50cm long! This means some Woodpeckers may weigh around 0.25 oz while
                other types may have a weight of around 20 oz.
                The colors of Woodpeckers are diverse. Some are multicolored while some have black bodies tinted with
                olive
                and brown. The common Woodpeckers in Southern Asia have black bodies with white spots and yellow shades
                along with red feathers on the head. These color combinations are important for camouflage.
                Except for some, most Woodpeckers have short legs with zygodactyl feet. While two toes face forward, the
                other two are bent backward. This toe arrangement helps them to get a good grip of the trunk and move
                vertically up to the tree.
                Woodpeckers have sharp and strong beaks for effective drilling into the trunk. The long sticky tongue
                helps
                them grasp insects. To prevent brain damage due to repeated drilling and pecking, Woodpeckers have
                certain
                features.
                Woodpeckers have a flexible and small brain. Its subdural cavity is narrow with minimal CSF which
                controls
                and restricts the movement of the brain inside the skull preventing severe brain damage. The CSF also
                monitors brain orientation with the skull allowing short contact.
                The skull has soft and flexible bones covering the forehead and the backside of the skull. Another
                special
                feature is the hyoid bone. This bone supports the skull as well as the spinal cord. It goes around the
                braincase going through both sides of the spinal cord and ends at the right nostril cavity. This bone
                safeguards the brain.

                <h3 class="topic">Lifestyle of Woodpeckers</h3>

                <p class="description">

                    Lifestyles are different for different species. Some Woodpeckers live solitary lives while some
                    prefer
                    to live in a group. Their common behaviors include head shaking and sharp vocalization. They are
                    also
                    known for heavily drilling and pecking through the woods. Woodpeckers roam in the daylight and rest
                    in
                    their nest at night.
                    Drumming is a common characteristic of the Woodpecker bird. They peck into the wood vigorously and
                    repeatedly. They take breaks and start drumming again. Male Woodpeckers do this more often than
                    female
                    Woodpeckers. This works like a territorial call. This is a sign to other Woodpecker mates and
                    various
                    drumming patterns have different meanings that the species understand.
                    Their voice is high-pitched and different Woodpeckers have diverse ways of calling. Some Woodpeckers
                    make rattling sounds while the other species whistle. Some species wail and scream. Some other
                    Woodpeckers make nasal churrs. However, each type of calling pattern carries a message to the fellow
                    Woodpeckers. Some calls denote danger while some calls indicate a call for food.
                    Woodcutter birds often make low-pitched sounds as well. Woodpecker couples usually make low-pitched
                    sounds when they are in the nest. The interval between each call also carries a message to the other
                    Woodpeckers.

                    <h3 class="topic">The Breeding Pattern of Woodpeckers</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        The main features of Woodpecker include making holes in the barks and making nests inside the
                        holes.
                        They mostly choose rotten or dead woods to make such nests. In places where there are inadequate
                        trees, they make nests in large cacti. Some Woodpeckers fully rely on the ground making holes
                        under
                        the earth and live there.
                        Some Woodpeckers also make nests in the bamboo forests. Some occupy the nests of termites and
                        ants.
                        In urban areas, they choose wooden utility poles to make their nests. However, wrynecks are
                        unable
                        to make their own nests. They need to find a premade nest to settle. Woodpeckers usually collect
                        wood pieces to make the nest. They make flooring with these wood pieces inside the hole.
                        Premade holes are often occupied by other Woodpeckers and thus there remains a constant
                        competition
                        to make a nest. Even other birds like sparrows may start breeding the holes and in such
                        situations,
                        Woodpeckers need to fight violently to take over the place.
                        Most Woodpeckers are monogamous while only a few species are polygamous. In rare cases, a group
                        of
                        Woodpeckers may take care of the young. Researchers say that group breeding is more successful
                        than
                        individual breeding.
