                <p class="description">
                    Woodpeckers scientific name is Picinea which is a part of the family Picidae. The subfamily Picinea
                    has
                    a
                    variety of 180 birds including Woodpeckers. As the name suggests, it is famous for pecking into the
                    woods.
                    Most of the time they are found on the trunk of a tree, striking into the woods to find insects.
                    They
                    also
                    peck dead woods to make nest holes where they can live.
                    Woodpeckers are commonly found worldwide except in a few places. These excluded areas are New
                    Zealand,
                    New
                    Guinea, Australia, and polar regions. These stunning birds are amply found in Southeast Asian and
                    South
                    American countries. They mostly like to live in forests and woodland areas where they can get enough
                    trees.
                    However, only some species like the Gila Woodpecker survive in rocky or desert areas.
                    Some Woodpeckers don't peck wood at all. They survive in the ground by making holes through the
                    grounds
                    to
                    form their nests. Also, they pick up insects from the ground for a living. These Woodpeckers are
                    found
                    in
                    rocky and grassy mountains located in South Africa.

                <p class="description">
                    Woodpecker information may vary as there are multiple types. The size of Woodpeckers starts from 7cm
                    in
                    length. Also, some Woodpeckers are 50cm long! This means some Woodpeckers may weigh around 0.25 oz
                    while
                    other types may have a weight of around 20 oz.
                    The colors of Woodpeckers are diverse. Some are multicolored while some have black bodies tinted
                    with
                    olive
                    and brown. The common Woodpeckers in Southern Asia have black bodies with white spots and yellow
                    shades
                    along with red feathers on the head. These color combinations are important for camouflage.
                    Except for some, most Woodpeckers have short legs with zygodactyl feet. While two toes face forward,
                    the
                    other two are bent backward. This toe arrangement helps them to get a good grip of the trunk and
                    move
                    vertically up to the tree.
                    Woodpeckers have sharp and strong beaks for effective drilling into the trunk. The long sticky
                    tongue
                    helps
                    them grasp insects. To prevent brain damage due to repeated drilling and pecking, Woodpeckers have
                    certain
                    features.
                    Woodpeckers have a flexible and small brain. Its subdural cavity is narrow with minimal CSF which
                    controls
                    and restricts the movement of the brain inside the skull preventing severe brain damage. The CSF
                    also
                    monitors brain orientation with the skull allowing short contact.
                    The skull has soft and flexible bones covering the forehead and the backside of the skull. Another
                    special
                    feature is the hyoid bone. This bone supports the skull as well as the spinal cord. It goes around
                    the
                    braincase going through both sides of the spinal cord and ends at the right nostril cavity. This
                    bone
                    safeguards the brain.

                    <h3 class="topic">Lifestyle of Woodpeckers</h3>

                    <p class="description">

                        Lifestyles are different for different species. Some Woodpeckers live solitary lives while some
                        prefer
                        to live in a group. Their common behaviors include head shaking and sharp vocalization. They are
                        also
                        known for heavily drilling and pecking through the woods. Woodpeckers roam in the daylight and
                        rest
                        in
                        their nest at night.
                        Drumming is a common characteristic of the Woodpecker bird. They peck into the wood vigorously
                        and
                        repeatedly. They take breaks and start drumming again. Male Woodpeckers do this more often than
                        female
                        Woodpeckers. This works like a territorial call. This is a sign to other Woodpecker mates and
                        various
                        drumming patterns have different meanings that the species understand.
                        Their voice is high-pitched and different Woodpeckers have diverse ways of calling. Some
                        Woodpeckers
                        make rattling sounds while the other species whistle. Some species wail and scream. Some other
                        Woodpeckers make nasal churrs. However, each type of calling pattern carries a message to the
                        fellow
                        Woodpeckers. Some calls denote danger while some calls indicate a call for food.
                        Woodcutter birds often make low-pitched sounds as well. Woodpecker couples usually make
                        low-pitched
                        sounds when they are in the nest. The interval between each call also carries a message to the
                        other
                        Woodpeckers.

                        <h3 class="topic">The Breeding Pattern of Woodpeckers</h3>

                        <p class="description">
                            The main features of Woodpecker include making holes in the barks and making nests inside
                            the
                            holes.
                            They mostly choose rotten or dead woods to make such nests. In places where there are
                            inadequate
                            trees, they make nests in large cacti. Some Woodpeckers fully rely on the ground making
                            holes
                            under
                            the earth and live there.
                            Some Woodpeckers also make nests in the bamboo forests. Some occupy the nests of termites
                            and
                            ants.
                            In urban areas, they choose wooden utility poles to make their nests. However, wrynecks are
                            unable
                            to make their own nests. They need to find a premade nest to settle. Woodpeckers usually
                            collect
                            wood pieces to make the nest. They make flooring with these wood pieces inside the hole.
                            Premade holes are often occupied by other Woodpeckers and thus there remains a constant
                            competition
                            to make a nest. Even other birds like sparrows may start breeding the holes and in such
                            situations,
                            Woodpeckers need to fight violently to take over the place.
                            Most Woodpeckers are monogamous while only a few species are polygamous. In rare cases, a
                            group
                            of
                            Woodpeckers may take care of the young. Researchers say that group breeding is more
                            successful
                            than
                            individual breeding. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Culpa
