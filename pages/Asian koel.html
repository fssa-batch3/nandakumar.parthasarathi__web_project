            <p class="description">
                The Asian koel is a large member of the cuckoo family and like many of its related cuckoo kin is a brood
                parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. The male Asian
                koel is glossy bluish-black, with a pale greenish grey bill, the iris is crimson, and it has grey legs
                and feet. The female is brownish on the crown and has rufous streaks on the head. The back, rump, and
                wing coverts are dark brown with white and buff spots. The underparts are whitish but are heavily
                striped. The upper plumage of young birds is more like that of the male and they have a black beak.

            <p class="description">
                Asian koels are shy birds that are usually more often heard than seen. They spend their time singly or
                in pairs hiding in the dense canopy. Asian koels feed by day taking fruits directly from trees; they may
                sometimes defend favored trees and chase away other frugivores. Asian koels are very vocal especially
                during the breeding season, making a range of different calls. The familiar song of the male is a
                repeated 'koo-Ooo' and the female makes a rhythmic 'wook-wook' and shrill 'kik-kik-kik...' call.

                    Asian koels are omnivores and consume a variety of insects, caterpillars, eggs, and small
                    vertebrates. Adults, however, feed mainly on fruit.

                    <p class="description">
                        The breeding season of Asian koels varies depending on location. In the Indian Subcontinent, it
                        usually occurs from March to August. These birds don't build a nest and lay their eggs in the
                        nests of a variety of birds, including the jungle crow, and house crow. They typically choose
                        host nests that are located at low heights and nearer to fruit trees. Males may distract the
                        hosts so that the female gets a chance to lay an egg in the nest. More often, however, the
                        female visits the nest of the host alone. She usually lays only 1 egg or 2 in a single nest but
                        as many as 7 to 11 eggs have been reported from some host nests. A female may remove a host egg
                        before laying. The eggs of the koel hatch in 12 to 14 days, about 3 days ahead of the host
                        chicks. The young koel does not always push out eggs or evict the host chicks, and initially
                        calls like a crow. It usually fledges in 20 to 28 days and unlike some other cuckoos, the young
                        koel does not attempt to kill the host chicks.<br><br>
