        <h2 class="howcanhelp" id="Drinking Water">Drinking water</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="des-howcan">Birds need water for drinking and bathing. Water is particularly important during the
            winter when natural supplies may be frozen and in dry, hot weather during the summer when water can be hard
            to find.

            Birds have no sweat glands, so they need less water than mammals. However, they do lose water through
            respiration and in their droppings. Most small birds need to drink at least twice a day to replace the lost
            water.

            Birds get the liquid they need from their food and by drinking. Many insectivorous birds get most of their
            water from food. Seed-eating birds have a dry diet and they do need to drink more.

            Water is freely available to small birds at the shallow edges of ponds and streams. They may also drink
            water droplets that form on leaves, especially if they live in woodland. Aerial species such as swallows and
            swifts swoop down onto a water body and scoop up a beakful of water while still in flight. Very impressive!

            Most birds drink by dipping their bill in water and throwing their head back to swallow. Pigeons and doves
            are able to immerse their beaks and can drink continuously.</p>

        <h2 class="howcanhelp_even" id="Bathing">bathing</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="des-howcan_even">Water to bathe in is just as important for birds, especially in winter. It is
            essential that they keep their feathers in good condition. Bathing is an important part of feather
            maintenance. Dampening the feathers loosens the dirt and makes their feathers easier to preen.

            When preening, birds carefully rearrange the feathers and spread oil from the preen gland so they remain
            waterproof and trap an insulating layer of air underneath to keep them warm.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div>
        <h2 class="howcanhelp" id="Keeping water clean">Keeping water clean</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="des-howcan">Keeping a bird bath clean helps to prevent birds catching diseases.

            You should clean your birdbath regularly and change the water. A layer of algae, dead leaves or bird
            droppings will soon build up, so give the bath a thorough clean every week or so. Scrub the sides and bottom
            to remove algae and other dirt.

            You can use dilute household disinfectants, but make sure that you rinse the bath out thoroughly to remove
            any traces of chemicals.

            There are two non-toxic products on the market, Enviroclens and Ark-Klens, which can be used to clean bird
            baths.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div>
        <h2 class="howcanhelp_even" id="Keeping water ice free">How to keep the water ice-free</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="des-howcan_even">Birds need to drink regularly, whether the weather's hot or cold. They'll even bathe
            in the depths of winter. In freezing conditions, bird baths and garden ponds become even more important,
            since many natural sources of water are frozen over.

            It can be difficult to stop a bird bath from freezing, but try these simple methods:

            A light ball floating in the water will be moved by even a gentle breeze, and will keep a small amount of
            water ice-free
            Pour on hot water to melt the ice
            Line the bath with a polythene sheet that you can lift out along with the ice
            Put a metal container on three or four bricks with a night light candle underneath, sheltering the flame
            from the wind with extra bricks
            Use an immersion heater controlled by a thermostat, or a lightbulb inside a tiling pipe on which the dish is
            resting. They must be fitted with suitable external wiring
            The ultimate is the Solar Sipper, a bird bath that uses solar energy to prevent the water from freezing.
            Avoid chemicals
            Never add any chemicals (such as glycerine, anti-freeze or salt) to the water. It could stop the birds'
            feathers from being waterproof, or poison the birds themselves.

                    remains, allowing deadly diseases such as rabies and tuberculosis to develop and spread. Over its
                    lifetime, a single vulture provides waste disposal services worth around US$11,600.

                    around the world. In New Zealand’s forests, 70% of the plants have seeds dispersed by birds

                    transform pollutants into nutrients. But without birds, many of these ecosystems may not exist.
                    Birds maintain the delicate balance between plant and herbivore, predator and prey. A perfect
                    example is the salt marshes of south-eastern USA, where cordgrass thrives, filtering local water and
                    protecting the coast from sea erosion
