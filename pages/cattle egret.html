            <p class="description">
                The short, thick-necked Cattle Egret spends most of its time in fields rather than streams. It forages
                at the feet of grazing cattle, head bobbing with each step, or rides on their backs to pick at ticks.
                This stocky white heron has yellow plumes on its head and neck during breeding season. Originally from
                Africa, it found its way to North America in 1953 and quickly spread across the continent. Elsewhere in
                the world, it forages alongside camels, ostriches, rhinos, and tortoises—as well as farmers’ tractors.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="topic">SIZE & SHAPE</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Compared with other herons, Cattle Egrets are noticeably small and compact. They have relatively short
                legs and a short thick neck. The straight, daggerlike bill is shorter and thicker than other herons.
                They have medium-length, broad, rounded wings.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h3 class="topic">COLOR PATTERN</h3>

                <p class="description">
                    Adult Cattle Egrets are all white with a yellow bill and legs. In breeding plumage they have golden
                    plumes on their head, chest, and back. Juveniles have dark legs and bill.

                    <h3 class="topic">BEHAVIOR</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        Cattle Egrets stalk insects and other small animals on the ground in grassy fields. They are
                        much less often seen in water than other herons. They nest in dense colonies of stick nests in
                        trees or emergent wetlands, often mixed with other species of herons.

                    <h3 class="topic">HABITAT</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        They forage in flocks in upland areas such as pastures and fields, generally focusing on drier
                        habitats than other species of white herons.

                    <h3 class="topic">COOL FACTS</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        Cattle Egrets are native to Africa but somehow reached northeastern South America in 1877. They
                        continued to spread, arriving in the United States in 1941 and nesting there by 1953. In the
                        next 50 years, they became one of the most abundant of the North American herons, showing up as
                        far north as Alaska and Newfoundland.<br><br>
                        Cattle Egrets follow large animals or machines and eat invertebrates stirred up from the ground.
                        They will fly toward smoke from long distances away, to catch insects fleeing a fire.
                        The Cattle Egret has a broad and flexible diet that occasionally includes other birds. In the
                        Dry Tortugas off the coast of Florida, migrating Cattle Egrets have been seen hunting migrating
                        warblers.<br><br>
                        Cattle Egrets have many names around the world, usually referencing the grazing animals they
                        team up with to forage. In various languages they are known as cow cranes, cow herons, cow
                        birds, elephant birds, rhinoceros egrets, and hippopotamus egrets.
                        The oldest Cattle Egret on record was at least 17 years old when it was captured and released in
                        Pennsylvania in 1979. It was originally banded in Maryland in 1962.
