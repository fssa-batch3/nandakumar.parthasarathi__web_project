            <p class="description">
                The ashy prinia or ashy wren-warbler is a small warbler in the family Cisticolidae. This prinia is a
                resident breeder in the Indian Subcontinent, ranging across most of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, eastern
                Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and western Myanmar. It is a common bird in urban gardens and farmland in
                many parts of India and its small size, distinctive colours and upright tail make it easy to identify.
                The northern populations have a rufous rump and back and have a distinct breeding and non-breeding
                plumage while other populations lack such variation.

            <h3 class="topic">General Characteristics</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Like most warblers, the ashy prinia is insectivorous. The song is a repetitive tchup, tchup, tchup or
                zeet-zeet-zeet. Another call is a nasal tee-tee-tee. It also makes a sound like "electric sparks" during
                its fluttery flight, which is thought to be produced by the wings, although one author suggests that it
                is made by the beak.[3][5]

                It is most easily distinguished by the loud snapping noise it makes during flight. How this noise is
                produced we do not know for certain. Reid was of opinion that the bird snapped its long tail. What
                exactly this means I do not know. Jesse believes that the sound is produced by the bird's mandibles. I
                have spent much time in watching the bird, and am inclined to think that the noise is caused by the
                beating of the wings against the tail. This last is constantly being wagged and jerked, and it seems to
                me that the wings beat against it as the bird flits about. When doves and pigeons fly, their wings
                frequently meet, causing a flapping sound. I am of opinion that something similar occurs when the ashy
                wren-warbler takes to its wings.

                — Douglas Dewar[6]
                The non-migratory genus Prinia shows biannual moult, which is rare among passerines. One moult occurs in
                spring (April to May) and another moult occurs in autumn (October to November). Biannual moult is
                theorized to be favoured when ectoparasite loads are very high; however, no investigations have been
                made. Prinia socialis moults some remiges twice a year and is termed to have a partially biannual
                moult;[7] however, some authors describe P. socialis socialis as having two complete moults.[4]

                Birds stay in pairs but roost singly on the branch of a small tree or shrub.[8]

                <p class="description">

                    This passerine bird is found in dry open grassland, open woodland, scrub and in home gardens in many
                    cities. The northern limits of the species are along the Himalayan foothills extending into the
                    upper Indus river system. The species is absent from the dry desert zone of the west of India and
                    extends east into Burma. The Sri Lankan population is found mainly in the lowlands but going up into
                    the hills to about 1600 m

                    <h3 class="topic">The Breeding Pattern </h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        The song is sung from the top of a bush and males make fluttery display flights with the tail
                        held up. The ashy prinia builds its nest close to the ground in a shrub or tall grass. Several
                        types of nests have been described, including a flimsy cup made by sewing several large leaves,
                        an oblong purse-like structure with grass stems inside it, and a flimsy ball of grass.[4][9] The
                        usual nest is built low in a bush and consists of leaves stitched together with webs, lined with
                        hair and having an entrance on the side.[10] It lays 3 to 5 glossy, somewhat oval-shaped eggs.
                        They vary in colour from brick-red to rich chestnut. The broad end of the egg is generally
                        darker than the remainder of the shell, and exhibits a cap or zone. The eggs measure 15 to 17 mm
                        (0.6 to 0.7 in) in length, and 11 to 13 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) in breadth.[11] They hatch in about
                        12 days.[12]

                        The breeding season varies with locality and has been recorded around the year, but mostly after
                        the monsoons.[13] In northern India it is mainly June to September and in Sri Lanka mainly
                        December to March or August to October.[3] Breeding season is during May to June in the
                        Nilgiris.[11] The species is believed to be monogamous, and both the male and the female take
                        part in incubation and feeding, though to varying extents.[14] Parents may spend more time at
                        the nest during cool days.[15][16] The eggs hatch in about 12 days.[13] Plaintive and
                        grey-bellied cuckoos are known to be brood parasites of this species.[17] When the nest is
                        threatened by predators such as cats, adults have been observed feigning injury.[12]

                        Rare cases of birds reusing material from a nest to build a nest at a new location have been
                        noted
