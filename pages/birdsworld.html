About bird : "Woodpeckers scientific name is Picinea which is a part of the family Picidae. The subfamily Picinea has a variety of 180 birds including Woodpeckers. As the name suggests, it is famous for pecking into the woods. Most of the time they are found on the trunk of a tree, striking into the woods to find insects. They also peck dead woods to make nest holes where they can live. Woodpeckers are commonly found worldwide except in a few places. These excluded areas are New Zealand, New Guinea, Australia, and polar regions. These stunning birds are amply found in Southeast Asian and South American countries. They mostly like to live in forests and woodland areas where they can get enough trees. However, only some species like the Gila Woodpecker survive in rocky or desert areas. Some Woodpeckers don't peck wood at all. They survive in the ground by making holes through the grounds to form their nests. Also, they pick up insects from the ground for a living. These Woodpeckers are found in rocky and grassy mountains located in South Africa.""


General Characteristics : "Woodpecker information may vary as there are multiple types. The size of Woodpeckers starts from 7cm in length. Also, some Woodpeckers are 50cm long! This means some Woodpeckers may weigh around 0.25 oz while other types may have a weight of around 20 oz. The colors of Woodpeckers are diverse. Some are multicolored while some have black bodies tinted with olive and brown. The common Woodpeckers in Southern Asia have black bodies with white spots and yellow shades along with red feathers on the head. These color combinations are important for camouflage. Except for some, most Woodpeckers have short legs with zygodactyl feet. While two toes face forward, the other two are bent backward. This toe arrangement helps them to get a good grip of the trunk and move vertically up to the tree. Woodpeckers have sharp and strong beaks for effective drilling into the trunk. The long sticky tongue helps them grasp insects. To prevent brain damage due to repeated drilling and pecking, Woodpeckers have certain features. Woodpeckers have a flexible and small brain. Its subdural cavity is narrow with minimal CSF which controls and restricts the movement of the brain inside the skull preventing severe brain damage. The CSF also monitors brain orientation with the skull allowing short contact. The skull has soft and flexible bones covering the forehead and the backside of the skull. Another special feature is the hyoid bone. This bone supports the skull as well as the spinal cord. It goes around the braincase going through both sides of the spinal cord and ends at the right nostril cavity. This bone safeguards the brain.



Life styes :Lifestyles are different for different species. Some Woodpeckers live solitary lives while some prefer to live in a group. Their common behaviors include head shaking and sharp vocalization. They are also known for heavily drilling and pecking through the woods. Woodpeckers roam in the daylight and rest in their nest at night. Drumming is a common characteristic of the Woodpecker bird. They peck into the wood vigorously and repeatedly. They take breaks and start drumming again. Male Woodpeckers do this more often than female Woodpeckers. This works like a territorial call. This is a sign to other Woodpecker mates and various drumming patterns have different meanings that the species understand. Their voice is high-pitched and different Woodpeckers have diverse ways of calling. Some Woodpeckers make rattling sounds while the other species whistle. Some species wail and scream. Some other Woodpeckers make nasal churrs. However, each type of calling pattern carries a message to the fellow Woodpeckers. Some calls denote danger while some calls indicate a call for food. Woodcutter birds often make low-pitched sounds as well. Woodpecker couples usually make low-pitched sounds when they are in the nest. The interval between each call also carries a message to the other Woodpeckers.



Breeding pattern : The main features of Woodpecker include making holes in the barks and making nests inside the holes. They mostly choose rotten or dead woods to make such nests. In places where there are inadequate trees, they make nests in large cacti. Some Woodpeckers fully rely on the ground making holes under the earth and live there. Some Woodpeckers also make nests in the bamboo forests. Some occupy the nests of termites and ants. In urban areas, they choose wooden utility poles to make their nests. However, wrynecks are unable to make their own nests. They need to find a premade nest to settle. Woodpeckers usually collect wood pieces to make the nest. They make flooring with these wood pieces inside the hole. Premade holes are often occupied by other Woodpeckers and thus there remains a constant competition to make a nest. Even other birds like sparrows may start breeding the holes and in such situations, Woodpeckers need to fight violently to take over the place. Most Woodpeckers are monogamous while only a few species are polygamous. In rare cases, a group of Woodpeckers may take care of the young. Researchers say that group breeding is more successful than individual breeding. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.

About bird : "The cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis ) is a cosmopolitan species of heron (family Ardeidae) found in the tropics, subtropics, and warm-temperate zones. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard its two subspecies as full species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.

It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands, and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations are migratory and others show postbreeding dispersal.

The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency, or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases."


General Characteristics : " The cattle egret is a medium sized bird, measuring 45 to 55 cm in length and weighing 250 to 500 grams. The wingspan is 90 to 95 cm. The egret has a hunched posture. The non breeding birds have complete white plumage with yellow bill and yellow-grey legs."


Life styes :The cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) is a very common resident bird that loves to stay in croplands and ponds. Yellow beaks, dark legs, in-breeding plumage, orange or buff heads are the common identification marks of the birds. The male and female look alike. They are a cosmopolitan species of herons.



Breeding pattern : The cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and cormorants.Adult Cattle Egrets are all white with a yellow bill and legs. In breeding plumage they have golden plumes on their head, chest, and back. Juveniles have dark legs and bill. Cattle Egrets stalk insects and other small animals on the ground in grassy fields.

Name: "Eagle"
Scientific Name : "Aquila"
Size : "85cm - 90cm"
Habitat: "https://iili.io/HvTyeI9.png"
Food1 : "https://iili.io/HvTy67V.png"


About bird : "In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An eagle may resemble a vulture in
build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped
with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live
prey."


General Characteristics : "1. Eagles Have Vision
If you ever happen to see an eagle sitting high above the tree or cliff of a stiff mountain, watch closely and see how attentive the bird is. The body sits still and the head will be tilted side to side to observed what is happening below, around and above it. Even if its flying close by, you can observe how keen its eyes are looking for its prey. Eagles have a keen vision. Their eyes are specially designed for long distance focus and clarity. They can spot another eagle soaring from 50 miles away.

Does this characteristic ring a bell in your mind? I am sure it does. Look at great leaders of this world who have come and gone. There are many great leaders that came and went but one characteristic that is common in all is "Vision". Vision is a successful leadership characteristic
You must have a vision that guides and leads your team towards the organization's or societal goals. The vision must be big and focused. A big, focused vision will produce big results.

2. Eagles are fearless
An eagle will never surrender to the size or strength of its prey. It will always give a fight to win its prey or regain its territory.
Try and watch the video on how the Golden Eagle displays remarkable hunting strategy, preying on goats much larger than itself by throwing them off the cliff face.
No matter what the size of that person or what weapon they maybe holding, you would attack them without thought or regard for yourself. It wouldn’t even dawn on you to be afraid because your instinct is to protect that which you love and cherish.
Successful leaders are fearless. They face problems head on.

3. Eagles are Tenacious
Watch an eagle when a storm comes. When other birds fly away from the storm with fear, an eagle spreads its mighty wings and uses the current to soar to greater heights. The eagle takes advantage of the very storm that lesser birds fear and head for cover.
Challenges in the life of a leader are many. These are the storm we must face as leaders to rise to greater heights. Like an eagle, a leader can only rise to greater heights if he takes up the challenges head on without running away from it. This is yet another leadership characteristic.

4. Eagles are High Flyers
Eagles can fly up to an altitude of 10,000 feet, but they are able to swiftly land on the ground. At 10, 000 feet, you will never find another bird. If you find another bird, it has to be an eagle.
An eagle doesn't mingle around with the pigeons. It was Dr. Myles Munroe who said that. Pigeons scavenge on the ground and grumble and complain all day long. Eagles are not. They fly and make less noise waiting for opportunities to strike their next prey or glide with the current of the storm.
Great leaders are problem solvers. They don't complain like the pigeons do. They love to take challenges as the eagle does when the storm comes.

5. Eagles Never Eat Dead Meat
An eagle never eats dead meat. In other words, an eagle does not scavenge. It only eats the meat from the prey it kills itself. Eagles eat raw and fresh meat What a great act of true leadership.
A true leader spends time with people who are vibrant and liberal in thinking. You have to be with people who can think, make informed decisions and take actions. These are the people who bring changes to the society. They are lively and active people. Go out and look for them.
According to Tony Buzan, a proponent of the techniques of Mind Mapping and mental literacy, these type of people are called change thinkers and change makers.
There is a saying that goes like this: "People you hang around with and the books you read eventually determines the person you become."

6. Eagles posses Vitality
Eagles are full of life and are visionary but they find time to look back at their life and re-energize themselves. This happens at about the age of 30. What happens is that when the eagles reach the age of 30, their physical body condition deteriorates fast making it difficult for them to survive.
What is really interesting is that the eagle never gives up living, instead it retreats to a mountaintop and over a five month period goes through a metamorphosis. It knocks off its own beak by banging it against a rock, plucks out its talons and then feathers. Each stage produces a re-growth of the removed body parts, allowing the eagle to live for another 30 - 40 years.

There are times in your life as a leader that you must look back and take stock of your life. The good and the bad experiences you have been through as a leader. Are you keeping in trend with the current knowledge trend? Do you need to improve your certain areas in your life as a leader?
Great leaders are the ones that always do "check and balance"of their personal and professional lives and make an effort to learn things every day.

7. Eagles Nurture their younger ones

Believe this or not. Eagles are known for their aggression. They are absolutely ferocious aren't they? Any one who doesn't have a total knowledge of this great bird will say yes. What is more astonishing with this bird is their ability to nurture their young ones. Research has shown that no member of the bird family is more gentle and attentive to its young ones than the eagles.

This is how it happens. When the mother eagle sees that time has come for it to teach the eaglets to fly, she gathers an eaglet onto her back, and spreading her wings, flies high. Suddenly she swoops out from under the eaglet and allows it to fall. As it falls, it gradually learns what its wings are for until the mother catches it once again. The process is repeated. If the young is slow to learn or cowardly, she returns it to the nest, and begins to tear it apart, until there is nothing left for the eaglet to cling to. Then she nudges him off the cliff.





Life styes :The cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) is a very common resident bird that loves to stay in croplands and ponds. Yellow beaks, dark legs, in-breeding plumage, orange or buff heads are the common identification marks of the birds. The male and female look alike. They are a cosmopolitan species of herons.





Breeding pattern : The female generally lays two eggs 3-4 days apart in March, and incubates them for 43-45 days. Incubation starts with the first egg, and the chicks hatch a few days apart. The first chick to hatch is dominant over the younger one, which has only a 20 per cent chance of surviving the crucial first weeks.

The female does most of the brooding and feeding of the young, while the male provides the female and the young with all the food, especially in the early stages. She broods the chicks almost continuously for the first two weeks. After this, she will regularly leave the nest and share the hunting with the male. 

The young will fledge when they are 65-70 days old, and will become independent after a further 90-100 days. Juveniles occasionally stay with their parents until November or December but are usually driven away by October. The young birds will breed for the first time at 3-4 years of age, when they can expect a lifespan of around 14 years. It is thought that 75 per cent of young birds die before reaching maturity. The oldest known golden eagle was more than 32 years old.

Food1 : ""


About bird : The Baya weaver (Ploceus philippinus) is a weaverbird best known for the elaborately woven nests constructed by the males. These birds spend their time in flocks and build their nest near water or place them hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily.

General Characteristics : Majority of weaver birds (plumages commonly) are yellow, but there are some in red, black or brown varieties while females are often dull brown colours. They are often known for their construction of embellished nests. A weaverbird is a small bird from the family Ploceidae.

Life styes : Baya weavers are social and gregarious birds. They forage during the day in flocks, both on the plants and on the ground. Flocks fly in close formations, often performing complicated maneuvers. They roost in reedbeds bordering waterbodies. Baya weavers may also sometimes descend to the ground and indulge in dust bathing. Their calls are a continuous ‘chit-chit-...’ sometimes ending in a wheezy ‘cheee-eee-ee’ that is produced by males in a chorus. A lower-intensity call is produced in the non-breeding season.

Breeding pattern :  Baya weavers are polygynous and don’t form pairs; males build many partial nests and begin courting females. The breeding season takes place during the monsoons. Baya weavers nest in colonies typically of up to 20-30 individuals, close to the source of food, nesting material, and water. Males build pendulous nests that are retort-shaped, with a central nesting chamber and a long vertical tube that leads to a side entrance to the chamber. The nests are woven with long strips of paddy leaves, rough grasses, and long strips torn from palm fronds. Each strip can be between 20 and 60 cm (7.9 and 23.6 in) in length. To complete a nest a male takes about 18 days and makes up to 500 trips. The birds use their strong beaks to strip and collect the strands and to weave and knot them while building their nests. The nests are often built hanging over water from palm trees and often suspended from thorny Acacias and in some cases from telephone wires. The females inspect the nest and signal their acceptance of a male; after that, the male goes on to complete the nest by adding the entrance tunnel. Females may modify the interiors or add blobs of mud. The female lays about 2-4 white eggs and incubates them for about 14 to 17 days. Males may sometimes assist in feeding the chicks. The chicks leave the nest after about 17 days. After mating with a female the male typically court other females at other partially constructed nests. Young birds leave the nest in juvenile plumage which is replaced in their first molt after about 4-6 months. The young usually disperse to new locations not far from their nest. Females start to breed after a year while males take half a year longer.

Scientific Name : Streptopelia chinensis
Size : "30cm"
Habitat: ""
Food1 : ""


About bird : The Spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis ) is a small and somewhat long-tailed pigeon that is a common resident breeding bird across its native range on the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia. The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and feral populations have become established.

General Characteristics : Description: Spotted Doves are mostly light brown above, with darker centres to the feathers of the back and wings. The head is grey, and the neck and underparts are grey-brown, tinged with pink. In flight the white-tipped tail is clearly seen.

Life styes : Spotted doves are usually in small flocks or pairs, foraging on the ground or perching in trees and on telephone wires. They have a rapid, powerful, and direct flight, but when leaving a perch to feed on the ground, they often glide down quietly. When not displaying, they will perch and call 'cuk cuk coorrr', the female’s call being quieter. Mated birds will preen each other (called allopreening), especially around their head and neck. Any aggressive behavior is usually accompanied by a threatening 'kirr' call, and this can escalate into a physical confrontation involving the slapping of wings. When disturbed, the Spotted dove rises quickly and heads for leafy cover. This species does not migrate but performs some dispersion to colonize other areas that are suitable

Breeding pattern :  Spotted doves are monogamous breeders. This means that both the male and the female have only one partner. They breed throughout the year, with most activity being from September to December. A male will perform a display flight, a steep rising flight accompanied by loud wing-clapping. When he gets to about 30 or 40 m in the air, he spreads his wings and tail and glides back down to a perch. He will also walk in front of a female, fluffing up the black and white patch on his neck, while bowing his head up and down. The adults build the nest together in a bush or tree, near an open area. The nest is a platform of loosely combined twigs, grasses, and roots. 1 or 2 slightly glossy white eggs are laid. Incubation is for around 14 to 16 days, by both parents. The altricial chicks are covered sparsely with pale down. For the first week, their parents look after them continuously. Young fledge when they are about 2 weeks old, and their parents immediately begin a new clutch.

Name: White cheeked Barbet
Scientific Name : Psilipogon virids
Size : "23cm"
Habitat: ""
Food1 : ""


About bird : This medium-sized barbet is one of the most characteristic and common birds of the Western Ghats of southwestern India and associated parts of the peninsula, being replaced in Sri Lanka by the closely related Yellow-fronted Barbet (Psilopogon flavifrons). Although largely a bird of moist forest habitats, it has expanded its range into several human-dominated habitats, and is now one of the most common birds in cities such as Bengaluru. It is readily distinguished from the larger Brown-headed Barbet (Psilopogon zeylanicus) by its white cheek-patch, higher-pitched call, and preference for wetter areas (although the two overlap in many areas). Largely frugivorous, its presence in parks and gardens within cities may be due to extensive planting of fruit trees, and it can sometimes be a pest in orchards. Its loud, ringing ku-troo calls audio are characteristic of the habitats it inhabits, and may be heard incessantly, especially during the warmer parts of the year. This barbet nests and roosts in excavated tree hollows, and is aggressive and territorial, competing fiercely with other barbets for suitable nest sites. Relatively well-studied compared to many other members of its family, this article summarizes what is known of the biology of this abundant, adaptable barbet.

General Characteristics : Barbets have short, rounded wings, a short tail, a large head on a short neck, and a stout, sharp-tipped bill. These birds have a distinctive “barbet” of bristles around the base of their beak.


Life styes : One of the most common birds, and the characteristic barbet of the evergreen and moist-deciduous forests of peninsular India, occurring from sea level to 1500 m, and up to 1800 m (occasionally 2300 m) in the Nilgiris. Also occurs in woodlands, gardens, groves, plantations, and parks in towns, villages, and the vicinity of human habitation photo (10). This last may be due to the presence of suitable fruit trees, especially Ficus, which have been planted in many Indian cities (1, 2). This species is particularly common, for instance, in the city of Bengaluru, where it is the most common barbet in parks and wooded areas (AK).

Breeding pattern :  In Periyar Tiger Reserve, white-cheeked barbets begin breeding in December and continue to nest until May. They are believed to form a pair bond that lasts for longer than a single breeding season. Calling is intense during the courtship period. Courtship feeding of the female by the male is usual prior to copulation. Calling intensity drops after the hatching of the eggs.The nest hole is usually made in dead branches. These barbets are aggressive towards smaller hole-nesters such as the Malabar barbet, sometimes destroying their nests by pecking at the entrance. Both sexes excavate the nest and it can take about 20 days to complete the nest. Eggs are laid about 3–5 days after nest excavation. About 3 eggs are laid. The incubation period is 14 to 15 days. During the day both sexes incubate, but at night, only the female sits on the eggs. The pair will defend their nests from palm squirrels which sometimes prey on the eggs. Chicks are fed an insect rich diet. The young leave the nest after 36 to 38 days.

These birds are primary cavity nesters, chiseling out the trunk or a vertical branch of tree with a round entry hole. They breed from December to July, sometimes raising two broods. Favoured nest trees in urban areas include gulmohur (Delonix regia ) and African tulip (Spathodea campanulata ). These nest holes may also be used as roosts. They may reuse the same nest tree each year but often excavate a new entrance hole.
