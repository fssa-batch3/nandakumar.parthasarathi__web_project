            <p class="description">

                In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An eagle may resemble a vulture in
                build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped
                with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live
                prey.

            <p class="description">
                <b>Size</b>: Their size varies considerably, ranging from the smallest South Nicobar serpent eagle of
                length 16
                in (40 cm) to the largest Harpy eagle and Philippine eagle measuring between 3 ft 2.5 in – 3 ft 3 in
                (98-100 cm).<br><br>
                <b>Wingspan</b>: These birds are noted for having the largest wingspans among avian predators, with the
                white-tailed eagle and Steller’s sea eagle having median wingspans of 7 ft 2 in (218.5 cm) and 7 ft
                (212.5 cm) respectively.<br><br>
                <b>Color</b>: Eagles typically have dark-colored, brown, or blackish feathers.<br><br>
                <b>Eyes</b>: The size of their eyes is similar to that of humans, and their eyesight is roughly 4-8
                times
                stronger as compared to the average human.<br><br>
                <b>Beak</b>: Like all predatory birds, eagles have large, hooked beaks for tearing flesh and killing
                their
                prey.<br><br>
                <b>Talons</b>: They possess curved, powerful claws that they use for catching prey.<br>

                <p class="description">

                    Most eagle species prefer building their nests on high cliffs and in tall trees near water bodies
                    like streams, lakes, and rivers. Since eagles are sensitive to disturbances caused by human
                    activity, they require extensive, undisturbed forested lands for nesting.<br>

                    <h3 class="topic">How long do they live</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        Eagles are apex avian predators and prey on a variety of birds, fish, small mammals, amphibians,
                        reptiles, and crabs. When food is scarce, these carnivores take advantage of decaying or dead
                        flesh. Bald eagles like eating fish while golden eagles primarily eat marmots, ground squirrels,
                        rabbits, bighorn sheep, and young pronghorn antelope.

                    <h3 class="topic">Behavior</h3>

                    <p class="description">
                        Eagles have large wings, and they enjoy flying at high altitudes.<br><br>
                        These predatory birds are excellent hunters, and they put up a fierce fight to regain their territory or win their prey no matter what its size or strength.<br><br>
                        Eagles use strong winds and upward air currents coming off mountains and hills to gain altitude and fly large distances, especially when migrating to another location. It keeps them from flapping their wings, which saves a significant amount of energy.<br><br>
                        When they get weak and old, eagles stay hidden in rocks and pluck their worn-out feathers. They wait in their hiding place until new feathers grow.<br><br>
